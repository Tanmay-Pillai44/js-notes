        <i>var vs let vs const.</i> <br>
        <b>Ans:</b> In Js, we have 3 types of variables (var, let, const). <br>
        1. var is global or functional scope. It can be reassigned. It can be redeclared. <br>
        2. let is block scoped. It can be reassigned. It cannot be redeclared. <br>
        3. const is vlock scoped. It cannot be reassigned. It cannot be redeclared. Have to assign value with declaration itself.
    </div> <br>
    <pre>
        console.log("Example for Var");
        var a=5;
        var a=10;
        console.log(a);      //5   //10

        console.log("Example for Let");
        let a=10;
        let a=20;      //we cannot redeclare.
        console.log(a);   //10    //error

        console.log("Example for Const");
        const a=10;
        a=20;
        console.log(a);  //throws error that assigned to fixed value (cannot be modified).
    </pre> <br>

    <div>
        <i>What is Hoisting?</i> <br>
        <b>Ans:</b> It is deafult Javascript Mechanism when our variables and functions declarations are moved to top of their scope before the code execution.
    </div> <br>
    <pre>
        console.log("Example of Hoisting");
        a=10;
        console.log(a);   //10
        var a;   // var a appears to move to the top of its scope.
    </pre> <br>

    <div>
        <i>What is Temperal Dead Zone?</i> <br>
        <b>Ans:</b> The time between the variables hoisted and the variables get initialized is called the TDZ.
    </div> <br>
    <pre>
        console.log("Example of TDZ");
        console.log(a);   //undefined
        console.log(b);   //Cannot access 'b' before initialization
        var a=10;
        let b=20;
    </pre>
