        <i>var vs let vs const.</i> <br>
        <b>Ans:</b> In Js, we have 3 types of variables (var, let, const). <br>
        1. var is global or functional scope. It can be reassigned. It can be redeclared. <br>
        2. let is block scoped. It can be reassigned. It cannot be redeclared. <br>
        3. const is vlock scoped. It cannot be reassigned. It cannot be redeclared. Have to assign value with declaration itself.
    </div> <br>
